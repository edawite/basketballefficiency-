Overview
The Basketball Shot Efficiency Calculator is a web-based tool that helps basketball players optimize their shot selection based on their shooting accuracy from different areas on the court. Users can input their shooting percentages for layups, midrange, and three-point shots. The tool calculates the most efficient shot distribution for three levels of play—Role Player, Starter, and Superstar—each with a specified number of shot attempts. The tool also provides a visual court representation with color-coded shooting zones based on efficiency.

Features
User Input for Shot Accuracy: Players input their shooting percentages for each of the following:
Layups: Left and Right
Midrange: Baseline Left, Wing Left, Middle, Wing Right, Baseline Right
Three-Pointers: Baseline Left, Wing Left, Middle, Wing Right, Baseline Right
Optimal Shot Selection: The calculator recommends an optimal number of shots for each playing level:
Role Player: 5 shots, requiring at least 2 shot types
Starter: 10 shots, requiring at least 4 shot types
Superstar: 19 shots, requiring up to 8 shot types
Shot Efficiency Visualization: An interactive basketball court highlights each shooting zone in green (high efficiency), light green, light red, or red (low efficiency), based on the player’s shooting percentage for that area.
